# Constraint-Aware News Recommendation System

A personalized news recommender built on the Microsoft MIND dataset that
maximizes engagement (CTR) while balancing diversity, freshness, and
recommendation-fatigue constraints.

## Tech stack
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Sentence-Transformers, PostgreSQL, MLflow,
Streamlit / Tableau.

## Project structure
- `data/` — raw + processed MIND data (gitignored)
- `notebooks/` — EDA and prototyping
- `src/` — recommenders, metrics, NLP modules
- `sql/` — schema and queries
- `dashboards/` — Streamlit app / Tableau workbooks
- `reports/` — product insights write-up and figures

## Problem Statement

    We want news readers to discover relevant, varied stories without being shown the same articles or topic
    repeatedly. We aim to cultivate an audience with repeat engagement across the time frame. A recommendation system focusing solely on click through rate can ruin recommendations and create feeds focused only on suggesting the most popular articles, encouraging repetition and narrowing topics; A long term retention risk.To balance the trade off, we should quantify the trade off between the demand for an increase in immediate engagement and a diverse recommendation system by identifying the exchange rate between engagement and diversity and recommend where it stops being worth paying. A success will be consistent click through rate, lowered topic repetition and increased intra list diversity, verified with experiment and guardrails. Failures can be identified when recommendations focus solely on few popular articles, users get suggested only a narrow set of topics, and readers are exposed to similar content leads to higher fatigue/churn.

## Exploratory Data Analysis — Key Findings

Full analysis in [`notebooks/03_eda.ipynb`](notebooks/03_eda.ipynb).

### Engagement is extremely concentrated across articles
Full article analysis in [`notebooks/03_article_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/03_article_analysis.ipynb).

- **Article-level click Gini = 0.94** (95% CI [0.94, 0.95]) — clicks are
  extraordinarily concentrated; a small set of articles captures nearly all
  engagement, with a long tail receiving almost none.
- **Article-level impression Gini = 0.92** — exposure is itself highly
  concentrated, so most click concentration is *exposure-driven*; engagement
  concentrates only modestly further (0.94 vs 0.92).
- **Top 1% of articles capture ~51.6% of all clicks.**

### Topic concentration: demand outpaces supply
Full topic analysis in [`notebooks/02_topic_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/02_topic_analysis.ipynb).

- **Subcategory:** click Gini **0.81** vs. impression Gini **0.76** — a small
  but statistically robust gap (paired bootstrap mean 0.05, 95% CI [0.03, 0.07]):
  engagement concentrates into a narrower set of subcategories than exposure does.
- **Category:** click Gini **0.51** vs. impression Gini **0.48** — moderate
  concentration (coarse, only ~18 categories).

### Product implication
Engagement is concentrated enough that a pure-CTR recommender would reinforce a
narrow popularity loop. This is the empirical case for the constraint-aware
approach: deliberately counterbalancing popularity with diversity and freshness
to surface the long tail without sacrificing engagement.

### User activity & cold-start
Full trend analysis in [`notebooks/04_trend_analysis.ipynb`](notebooks/04_trend_analysis.ipynb).

- 50k users; history is right-skewed (median 11 prior clicks, mean 18.5,
  max 558) — a small set of power users inflates the average.
- **Cold-start:** 1.8% of users have zero history; 26% have ≤5 prior clicks —
  motivating content-based methods alongside collaborative filtering.
- **Repeat exposure is weak at both grains.** Average top-category share is
  ~0.30 vs. the 0.27 global news share; average top-subcategory share is 0.108
  (≥20-impression users) vs. a null-model expectation of 0.096. Per-user topic
  concentration barely exceeds what random draws from the global mix produce —
  so the logged data shows little personalized topic lock-in.
- **Implication:** current exposure is healthily varied per user; the fatigue
  guardrail is therefore *preventive* — ensuring a CTR-optimizing ranker does
  not introduce narrowing — rather than fixing an existing problem. The active
  concentration risks are article-level popularity (Gini 0.94) and supply-side
  category imbalance (news 27%).

### Temporal trends
- **Impressions follow a clear daily cycle** — overnight trough, broad
  mid-morning peak (08:00–12:00) — confirming clean timestamp parsing.
- **CTR varies only modestly (~3.8%–4.3%).** Adding 95% confidence bands
  sharpened the read: the **08:00 peak** and **13:00 midday dip** are precise
  and robust (high volume, narrow bands), while the apparent late-evening
  CTR spike has wide intervals (low volume) and is **not** statistically
  distinguishable from the morning level — a reminder not to over-read
  low-sample hours.
- Window spans ~6 days (Nov 9–14, 2019), ~2x higher weekday volume; too short
  for weekly-seasonality claims.
